   * Returns an {@code InetAddress} object encapsulating what is most likely the machine's LAN IP
   * address.
   *
   * <p>This method is intended for use as a replacement of JDK method {@code
   * InetAddress.getLocalHost}, because that method is ambiguous on Linux systems. Linux systems
   * enumerate the loopback network interface the same way as regular LAN network interfaces, but
   * the JDK {@code InetAddress.getLocalHost} method does not specify the algorithm used to select
   * the address returned under such circumstances, and will often return the loopback address,
   * which is not valid for network communication. Details <a
   * href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4665037">here</a>.
   *
   * <p>This method will scan all IP addresses on all network interfaces on the host machine to
   * determine the IP address most likely to be the machine's LAN address. If the machine has
   * multiple IP addresses, this method will prefer a site-local IP address (e.g. 192.168.x.x or
   * 10.10.x.x, usually IPv4) if the machine has one (and will return the first site-local address
   * if the machine has more than one), but if the machine does not hold a site-local address, this
   * method will return simply the first non-loopback address found (IPv4 or IPv6).
   *
   * <p>If this method cannot find a non-loopback address using this selection algorithm, it will
   * fall back to calling and returning the result of JDK method {@code InetAddress.getLocalHost}.
   *
   * @return the LAN IP address
   * @throws UnknownHostException the LAN IP address could not be retrieved
